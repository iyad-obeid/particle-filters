# particle-filters
A few years ago, my lab got pretty into particle filtering and we looked at computationally efficient ways of using particle filters to track plasticity in neurons. This code represents a number of approaches.

I think all/most/some of this code works but it is in need of organization, cleanup, curation, etc. Its on the to-do list :)
